The Movies Production Insights Pipeline Project aimed to design and implement an efficient data pipeline for the movie industry. The primary objectives included:

- Data Integration: Consolidate diverse data sources related to persons, movies, genres, production, and more into a centralized data warehouse.

- Automation: Utilize Apache Airflow for automated orchestration of data pipelines, ensuring timely and accurate data processing.

- Transformation: Employ Pyspark for effective data extraction and transformation, enabling the conversion of raw data into a structured format suitable for analysis.

- Staging Area: Implement MongoDB as a NoSQL staging area for interim data storage, providing flexibility and scalability.

- ETL Process: Utilize Talend for Extract, Transform, Load (ETL) processes, facilitating the seamless transfer of data from the staging area to the PostgreSQL data warehouse.

- Change Data Capture (CDC): Implement a CDC strategy using the Meta_Data table to capture and track changes and use logic to archive all old files and receive only the latest files, ensuring the data warehouse reflects the latest information.

- Visualization: Integrate Power BI for insightful visualization, allowing users to explore trends, patterns, and relationships within the movie industry.
