The Movies Production Insights Pipeline Project aimed to design and implement an efficient data pipeline for the movie industry. The primary objectives included:
1
- Data Integration: Consolidate diverse data sources related to persons, movies, genres, production, and more into a centralized data warehouse.
2
- Automation: Utilize Apache Airflow for automated orchestration of data pipelines, ensuring timely and accurate data processing.
3
- Transformation: Employ Pyspark for effective data extraction and transformation, enabling the conversion of raw data into a structured format suitable for analysis.
4
- Staging Area: Implement MongoDB as a NoSQL staging area for interim data storage, providing flexibility and scalability.
5
- ETL Process: Utilize Talend for Extract, Transform, Load (ETL) processes, facilitating the seamless transfer of data from the staging area to the PostgreSQL data warehouse.
6
- Change Data Capture (CDC): Implement a CDC strategy using the Meta_Data table to capture and track changes, ensuring the data warehouse reflects the latest information.
7
- Visualization: Integrate Power BI for insightful visualization, allowing users to explore trends, patterns, and relationships within the movie industry.
